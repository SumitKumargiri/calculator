The Basic Web Calculator is a user-friendly calculator for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a clean and intuitive user interface that allows users to input numbers and perform calculations effortlessly.

Components:

HTML Structure:
The calculator's interface is built using HTML. It consists of a main container with various buttons, an input field to display the input and output, and a series of buttons for each digit and operator.

CSS Styling:
CSS is used to style the calculator and make it visually appealing. It involves setting the color scheme, adjusting the button sizes and fonts, and adding borders and shadows to the buttons for a more modern look.

JavaScript Functionality:
The calculator's functionality is implemented using JavaScript. It handles user interactions, captures button clicks, and performs the corresponding calculations. The JavaScript code performs the following actions:

Captures button clicks and inputs: When a user clicks on a digit or operator button, the JavaScript code captures the input and displays it on the input field.

Performing calculations: The calculator keeps track of the numbers and operators entered by the user and calculates the result when the equal (=) button is pressed. For example, if the user inputs "5 + 3 =", the JavaScript code will evaluate the expression and display "8" as the result.

Clearing the input: A clear (C) button is included to reset the input field and clear any previous calculations.

Error handling: The JavaScript code ensures that invalid inputs are handled gracefully, such as dividing by zero or entering invalid expressions.

Functionality Examples:
Let's go through some examples of how the calculator works:

Addition: User inputs "5 + 3 =" and the calculator displays "8".

Subtraction: The user inputs "10 - 2 =" and the calculator displays "8".

Multiplication: The user inputs "6 * 3 =" and the calculator displays "18".

Division: The user inputs "12 / 4 =" and the calculator displays "3".

Clear: The user presses the "C" button, and the input field is cleared.
